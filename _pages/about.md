I am currently a Research Assistant at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/). Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/). My research interests lie in Trustworthy AI, Graph Neural Networks, and LLMs. If you are interested in collaborating, please feel free to send me an email.
